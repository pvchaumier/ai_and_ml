# AI and Machine Learning

This repository contains the little projects I do that are linked in some way to Artificial Intelligence and/or Machine Learning.


## Projects

### Mastermind

A little implementation of the [mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_%28board_game%29) game and a solver. You can play the game as the one that guesses or as the one that makes the computer guess.


### 2048

Until now I have only implemented the famous [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) game. I hope to be able to implement soon a solution using reinforcement learning techniques.


## Comments ? Questions ? Improvement or contribution ?
